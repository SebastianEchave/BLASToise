# BLASToise
School project work-line to help in the analysis of frequencies for genes of interest in custom made data bases.

 **Welcome to BLASToise**, this is a simple project for a entry level coding class in data reading and analysis. 

Start by downloading the full project as a zip folder by clicking on the green "Code" button in the github homepage for this project, and save the zip file in a location of your convenience. Alternatevely, you may use the SSH link to import into your operating systme via the git bash command. 

You will find the main folder titled "Python Test Director". For the sake of accesibility and convenience, I suggest you make this your working directory when running this project. Within this folder you will find: Four .FASTA files that contain our genes of interest; A data folder titled "outpur_gbff_files" which holds all the genomes that we will use; and the main notebook with all the necessary coding for the run. 

Follow instructions in the notebook to get the two main components for the project: bipython, and BLAST+:
*To obtain biopython, simply enter in a command tab: pip install biopython
*To obtain BLAST+, open the link provided in the notebook. This will take you to a ftp page (File Transfer Protocol).
